What does the teacher think of the serialization we did, and the way we check for any changes
by comparing the serializables.

How should we handle the create/open/save menu, should we keep asking until it works?
should we only try once? and let it go. what exceptions should we throw if it does fail then?
any message passed onto the user to tell them it didnt work?
