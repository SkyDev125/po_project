In hotel.vaccinateAnimal where we need to check if the vet exists, we have the workers map, that throws the exception, yet then we need to downcast it into a vet right? should we have 2 independent maps for vets and caretakers? or try catch the exception that java might throw if it fails to downcast the object to vet? and then throw our own exception? or should we do an if isinstanceof to verify if it is vet. and throw the exception right there?
